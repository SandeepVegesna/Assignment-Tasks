After starting the application with npm start command need to hit the localhost:9000 url and check whether the code is running or not.
For creating the customer bank account need to hit the following url http://localhost:9000/testApi/createAccount/1. In the URL "1" will be the customer Id.
For getting the list of customer bank accounts need to hit http://localhost:9000/testApi/getAccount/1. In the URL "1" will be the customer Id.
I have created accounts model to fetch and save customer account details.
